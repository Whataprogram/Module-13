## Network Design Diagram

This repository contains a network design diagram created for Module 13 â€“ Task 3. The diagram includes:
- Two computers
- A printer
- A router

### Topology Selection
I selected a star topology because it offers centralized management and is easy to troubleshoot. 

### Included Components
- **Computers**: Represent the endpoints in the network.
- **Printer**: A shared network resource.
- **Router**: Manages traffic between the devices.
